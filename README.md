# poker-function

Mini-game that picks the winner from randomly selected hands
Here's what it does: give it two numbers, one for the number of decks you'd like to play with (between 1 and 100), and another
for the number of players (between 2 and 2000). The poker function will then return the winning hand!

Note: This function assumes a 5 card hand.
